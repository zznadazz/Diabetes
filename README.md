Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning:

We will try to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

The features:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration from an oral tolerance test
- Blood Glucose: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (kg/m2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
